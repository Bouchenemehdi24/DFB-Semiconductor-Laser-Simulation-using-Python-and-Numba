# Accelerate DFB Semiconductor Laser Simulation using Python and Numba


This Python script simulates the behavior of a distributed feedback (DFB) semiconductor laser.
It models the laser dynamics, output power over time, and optical spectrum. The simulation is based on a set of differential equations and numerical methods.

Customization

To adapt the existing code for different laser structures (such as quantum well or multiple quantum well), follow these steps:

1. Quantum Well (QW) Structure:
   - Modify the effective index (neff) and gain medium properties.
   - In a QW laser, the active region consists of thin quantum wells separated by barrier layers.
   - Adjust the material parameters (e.g., carrier density, differential gain, and non-linear gain saturation) to match QW characteristics.
   - Consider the impact of quantum confinement on carrier distribution and gain.

2. Multiple Quantum Well (MQW) Structure:
   - Similar to QW but with stacked wells.
   - Modify the simulation to account for multiple wells (each with its own properties) within the active region.
   - Adjust the carrier distribution equations to handle multiple energy levels.
   - Consider effects like inter-well coupling and tunneling.

Physics Behind DFB Laser:
- DFB lasers are semiconductor lasers with a periodic grating structure providing distributed feedback for single-mode operation.
- Carrier distribution, gain, and loss mechanisms affect laser behavior.
- The simulation accounts for spontaneous emission, gain saturation, and other physical effects.

Implementation Details:
- The actual implementation details are omitted for brevity.
- Users investigating the code should be familiar with time-dependent coupled wave equations and DFB laser physics.
- Ensure that you have the following libraries installed: numpy, matplotlib, scipy, numba

Simulation Parameters:
- Parameters (material properties, laser dimensions, facets reflectivity) are defined at the beginning of the script.
- Modify these parameters to study different laser configurations.

Output:
- The script computes the laser output power over time (right facet).
- It generates an optical spectrum (wavelength vs. relative power).
